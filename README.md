# TAMU-Howdy-Data
JSON representations of Texas A&amp;M University course data, going all the way back to 2009.
This data is updated on the first of every month, making it unsuitable for making scheduling decisions.
However, it could be useful for data analysis like determining if a course will be offered during a specific semester or not.

To run the Ruby script that collects the data locally, you'll want to have Ruby 2.7.0 installed.

Run `bundle install`, and then run `main.rb` and wait for the script to complete. This will take about an hour.
