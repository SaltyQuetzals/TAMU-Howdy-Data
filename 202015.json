There will be a focus on the indications for transplant, complications of self and donor transplantation, and long term impact on Immunity in terms of host defense, auto/alloimmunity (graft versus host disease), and in terms of preventing or treating relapse. This will likely be best for those interested in medical oncology and hematologic malignancies. Two- to four-week rotations suggested but there would be flexibility in the time frame. This will be principally a clinical rotation with a strong emphasis on the care of the marrow transplant patient.","division":null,"termStart":"201341","termEnd":"999999","preRequisiteCheckMethodCde":"B","anySections":null,"sections":[{"id":520546,"term":"202015","termDesc":"Spring 2020 - Half Year Term","courseReferenceNumber":"10166","partOfTerm":"M13","courseNumber":"819","subject":"IMED","subjectDescription":"IMED - Internal Medicine","sequenceNumber":"30D","campusDescription":"College Station","scheduleTypeDescription":"Clinic","courseTitle":"BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT","creditHours":null,"maximumEnrollment":250,"enrollment":8,"seatsAvailable":242,"waitCapacity":0,"waitCount":0,"waitAvailable":0,"crossList":null,"crossListCapacity":null,"crossListCount":null,"crossListAvailable":null,"creditHourHigh":10,"creditHourLow":1.25,"creditHourIndicator":"TO","openSection":true,"linkIdentifier":null,"isSectionLinked":false,"subjectCourse":"IMED819","faculty":[{"lastName":"Vance III","firstName":"Estil","middleName":"A","fullName":"Estil A Vance III","displayName":"Estil Vance III","preferenceFirstName":null,"namePrefix":null,"nameSuffix":null,"scheduleIndicator":"Y","advisorIndicator":null,"title":{"class":"org.grails.orm.hibernate.cfg.HibernatePersistentEntity","id":5,"version":0,"dataOrigin":null,"code":"INST","lastModified":"08/12/1991","lastModifiedBy":null,"description":"Instructor"},"deptAndCollegeInformation":null,"address":null,"telephone":null,"email":null,"bannerId":"65249","cvExists":false,"cvUrl":null,"tamuDirEmail":"","tamuDirTitle":"","tamuDirDept":"","tamutelephoneNumber":""}],"meetingsFaculty":[{"category":"01","class":"net.hedtech.banner.student.schedule.SectionSessionDecorator","courseReferenceNumber":"10166","faculty":[],"meetingTime":{"beginTime":null,"building":null,"buildingDescription":null,"campus":null,"campusDescription":null,"category":"01","class":"net.hedtech.banner.general.overall.MeetingTimeDecorator","courseReferenceNumber":"10166","creditHourSession":1.25,"endDate":"05/08/2020","endTime":null,"friday":false,"hoursWeek":0,"meetingScheduleType":"CLD","meetingType":"CLD","meetingTypeDescription":"Clinic","monday":false,"room":null,"saturday":false,"startDate":"01/06/2020","sunday":false,"term":"202015","thursday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false},"term":"202015"}],"reservedSeatSummary":null,"sectionAttributes":[{"class":"net.hedtech.banner.student.schedule.SectionDegreeProgramAttributeDecorator","code":"ADAL","courseReferenceNumber":"10166","description":"Dallas","isZTCAttribute":false,"termCode":"202015"},{"class":"net.hedtech.banner.student.schedule.SectionDegreeProgramAttributeDecorator","code":"NTFE","courseReferenceNumber":"10166","description":"NonTraditional Format Exclude","isZTCAttribute":false,"termCode":"202015"}],"termType":"NON-STANDARD","instructionalMethod":"","classRoster":"https://compass-sso.tamu.edu:443/ssomanager/c/SSB?pkg=bwykfcwl.P_FacClaListSum?term=202015&crn=10166","isAdvisor":null}]},"IMED 820":{"id":41041,"termEffective":"201831","courseNumber":"820","subject":"IMED","subjectCode":"IMED","college":"Medicine","collegeCode":"MD","department":"College of Medicine","departmentCode":"CLMD","courseTitle":"CARDIOLOGY IMAGING","durationUnit":null,"numberOfUnits":null,"attributes":null,"gradeModes":null,"ceu":null,"courseScheduleTypes":null,"courseLevels":null,"creditHourHigh":10,"creditHourLow":1.25,"creditHourIndicator":"TO","lectureHourLow":null,"lectureHourHigh":null,"lectureHourIndicator":null,"billHourLow":1.25,"billHourHigh":10,"billHourIndicator":"TO","labHourLow":null,"labHourHigh":null,"labHourIndicator":null,"otherHourLow":null,"otherHourHigh":10,"otherHourIndicator":"TO","description":null,"subjectDescription":"IMED - Internal Medicine","courseDescription":"Cardiology Imaging.

This elective is designed to expose the student to a pulmonary consultative experience. The student will rotate and see pulmonary consultations at Baylor University Medical Center and in a doctor&rsquo;s private office. Thus, the student will be exposed to patients with COPD, dyspnea, interstitial lung disease, pleural effusions, thromboembolic disease, and lung nodules, masses, and cancer. The student will be able to participate in bronchoscopies, thoracentesis, and pulmonary function testing. The objectives of the rotation are: 1. to teach interpretation of pulmonary function testing; 2. to teach interpretation of chest x-rays and CT scans; and 3. to be able to appropriately address and understand the evaluation and management of dyspnea; airway diseases such as asthma, COPD, and bronchitis; pleural effusions; lung masses; thromboembolic diseases; and interstitial diseases (pulmonary fibrosis).
